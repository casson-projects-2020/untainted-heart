# The Untainted Heart

> :memo: **note:** Base text for AI story engine

> :memo: **note:** This is not the code for the AI story engine itself - this repo contains the files (markdown files) that the engine will read to maintain a specific story - the Untainted Heart, in this case. To see the engine in action, visit [Fable Facet](http://fablefacet.com). (still in development, not released)<br/>


This story is open access - no author rights, copyright or royalties are due in any way - and this is also based on a story I read more than 30 years ago. I've tried to identify the story and was unable to - so if you have this info, please drop me a line.

If you are reading this on Fable Facet, the source files are on Github, https://github.com/casson-projects-2020/untainted-heart/. Feel free to open a discussion or an issue there.
