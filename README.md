# The Untainted Heart
Base text for AI story engine

This is not the code for the AI story engine itself - this repo contains the files (markdown files) that the engine will read to maintain a specific story - the Untainted Heart, in this case. To see the engine in action, visit [Fable Facet](http://fablefacet.com).<br/>

The story is, then, "open source" - no author rights, copyright or royalties are due in any way - and this is also based on a story I read more than 30 years ago. I tried to identify the story and was unable to - so if you have this info, please drop me a line. I intend to add a discord address here, but feel free to open an Issue until then.
