Almost all books have been lost, alongside with civilization.<br/>

The world is now radioactive, in ruins, deserted and covered in grey sand.<br/>

The remains, useless cars and sky-scrapers, tell about a past that don't exist anymore.<br/>

There is little love lost between most of the citizens of the deep buried cities and the Dusters: the ones that cross the desert in large closed tank-like vans, the sand-crawlers.<br/>

Scarce surface goods that no one else can produce are desired, but more and more people seem to think that the outside world should be forgotten - and the duster's runs are waste of resources.<br/>

All Dusters pursue a legend of a machine, the [Untainted Heart](untainted_heart.md), that can make people 
immune to radioactivity.<br/>

That justify the risks of fighting giant animals, and the men-mutants - the [howlers](howlers.md).
