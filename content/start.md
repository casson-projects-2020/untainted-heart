<main class="gender_neutral">
In a few hours, you’ll be back in the Burrow. 'No, stop it. Focus.' Dusters have a superstition about this: you relax when the mission is almost complete, and that’s when you make mistakes.

Sleep doesn’t help. You slap your own face and go to make some tea. The scorching sun outside would certainly help keep you awake, but the sand crawler’s windows are made of dark, heavy glass.

Speaking of which — glass. Those bastards asked you to bring glass. Not just any kind, but mirrored windows. You cursed the Agros for the thousandth time. It wasn’t that the job was 
hard; plenty of windows could be scavenged from the old skyscrapers. But you had a feeling this was another one of their crazy schemes, part of their eternal obsession with improving 
crop yields. They hadn't revealed the plan to any Duster yet.

'Well, nothing against better food.'

Suddenly, the alarm blares, making you spill the rest of your tea.

The scope isn't exactly a marvel of technology. If the path ahead gets much darker than it should, the alarm triggers. Looking at the feed, you see gray sand rising, forming clouds... too close.

'Damn it.' You should have been watching the scope. Relaxing near the end always breeds trouble.

You take the sand crawler off autopilot and attempt to veer away, already fearing the worst.

The Scorpion emerges from the cloud, right on top of the crawler. 

You let go of the controls — the direction doesn't matter anymore. You prep the sand cannon, but the damn creature has already climbed onto the crawler's roof.
The sound of its many legs scraping against the metal ceiling sends involuntary shivers down your spine.

Often, they realize they can't eat a crawler and just leave. But just as often, they sever the leg tubes — and that could turn a few hours' trip back to the Burrow into days. 
Days without supplies. Days of hunger.

The front cannon can't hit the roof — you’ll have to use one of the legs. You retract the front-right leg from the sand, and immediately feel the loss of buoyancy, sending the 
crawler into a long, heavy bank.

You deactivate the leg's air jet and divert the intake toward the sand—effectively turning the leg into another cannon. Not as powerful as the main ones, but the Scorpion 
won't like it. The momentary surge of air back into the crawler fills the cabin with the sharp scent of ozone.

The problem is: you’re firing blind.

You begin to wonder if there’s anything else you can do. Wild ideas race through your mind. Stop and wait? Risk a plow? Or a belly-flop? Damn, what would cause less damage than the scorpion? Try to trap the creature INSIDE the airlock? Open the hatch and fight? Run outside
the crawler to draw attention? But you’d have to put on your suit first — and while a Scorpion can’t slice through steel and lead, it can snap a person in half.
