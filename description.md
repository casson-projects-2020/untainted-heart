The books have been all destroyed, alongside with civilization. Nobody seems to remember what happened. It happened so long ago, it had faded away. There are no records of it.<br/>

As far as anyone remembers, the world was always radioactive, in ruins, deserted and covered in grey sand.<br/>

You all know that things were different in the past though. You see lots of cars abandoned and decayed, useless, from long ago. But most
impressive are the remains of the sky-scrappers: their impossibility - the sheer hubris of building so high in a world that can no 
longer manage to build on the surface.<br/>

All things of the past.<br/>

People were able to learn how to fix and even build ther own vehicles examining the ones from the past. The only way of travel is inside
those, large closed tank-like vans, the [sand crawlers](sand_crawlers.md) - vehicles and homes for the [dusters](dusters.md) 
\- as the ones who roam through the deserts using the crawlers are known.<br/> 

There is little love lost between most of the citizens and the Dusters, though - scarce surface goods that no one else can produce are
desired, but more and more people seem to think that the outside world should be forgotten - and the duster's runs are waste of resources.
<br/>
To walk outside, only in a radiation suit. The only safe places apart from the crawlers are the cities carved below the ground. But
there is a legend, that all dusters pursue: the legend of a machine, the [Untainted Heart](untainted_heart.md), that can make people 
immune to radioactivity.<br/>

This is what makes them alive and going, chasing this dream. That justify the risks of fighting giant animals, and the men-mutants - 
this ones known by several names but mostly [howlers](howlers.md), the remainder of what radiation can do to men or animals outside the cities. 
Nobody have ever found this machine so far.<br/>
