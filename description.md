Nobody seems to remember what happened. It happened so long ago, it have faded away. There is no records of it. As if the books have
been all destroyed, alongside with civilization.<br/>

As you see it, the world, as far as anyone remembers, was always radioactive, destroyed, deserted and covered in sand. You all know
that things were different in the past though.<br/>

You see the remains of buildings, that no one seems to be able to build anymore. And lots of cars abandoned and decayed, useless, long
ago. All things of the past.<br/>

You were able to learn how to fix and even build your own vehicles examining the ones from the past. The only way of travel is inside
those, large closed tank-like vans, the [sand crawlers](sand_crawlers.md) - vehicles and homes for the [travelers](travelers.md) 
\- as the ones who roam through the deserts using the crawlers are known.<br/> 

To walk outside, only in a radiation suit. The only safe places apart from the crawlers are the cities carved below the ground. But
there is a legend, that all travelers pursue: the legend of a machine, the [Untainted Heart](untainted_heart.md), that can make people 
immune to radioactivity.<br/>

his is what make them alive and going, chasing this dream. That justify the risks of the giant animals, and the men-mutants - 
this ones called twisteds, or [howlers](howlers.md), the remainder of what radiation can do to men or animals outside the cities. 
Nobody have ever found this machine so far.<br/>
